# Laptop_Battery_Logger
A simple program that captures your battery status and logs it into a CSV file

This program simply checks your battery percentage once each min and logs the data of percentage and if the laptop is plugged in or not in a csv file.

As an additional feature. After setting the Max and Min battery percentage, we get a notification telling us to disconnect the plug once charged and connect when discharged.

### Exe file
Using pyinstaller I have made a .exe file for the python file. It runs in the background and just works
